# QBB - Quantile-Based Binarization of 3D Point Cloud Descriptors
## Standalone binary descriptors

Here you can find the python implementation of feature descriptors with binary descriptors as the result.
These implementations were used to generate binary descriptors for the comparisons.

### Usage

These methods were written in a way that the descriptor settings should be given in the generator object's constructor. Then those objects can create binarized feature descriptors for a cloud.
To see this in work you can check the `examples` folder.
