# QBB - Quantile-Based Binarization of 3D Point Cloud Descriptors
## Binarization methods

Here you can find the python implementation of binarization techniques.
These implementations were used when we calculated the binary descriptors for the comparisons.

### Usage

These methods were written in a way that the binarization settings should be given in the binarizer object's constructor. Then those objects can create binarized versions of feature descriptors.
To see this in work you can check the `examples` folder.
